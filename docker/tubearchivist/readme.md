# Tube Archivest

This lets you subscribe to youtube channels and download the videos.

Useful for:

* Archiving youtube channels
* Downloading videos for offline viewing   
* For video editing
* For videos likely to be taken down

This is a basic set up but it works. Things I'd like to add/do:

* Persistent database, it might be now, but I don't know where it is
* Get this running in "prod" now that I've done a proof of concept
